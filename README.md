We realized students/supporters were having trouble talking about Cal Poly's new dorms, mainly because their Northern Chumash names couldn't be typed out on a keyboard. In addition, many people didn't even know how to pronounce names such as yakʔitʸutʸu. To aid with both these issues, we created this Google Chrome extension that makes it easy to copy each building name into your text conversations as well as listen to how each should be pronounced. Hopefully this simple tool will help your future Facebook posts or reddit rants.
